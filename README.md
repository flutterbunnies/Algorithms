### Algorithms
This repository is for students in Professor Yuen's Fall 2017 Discrete Structures class, CS 942, at West Los Angeles College.
The preferred language to be used in the repository is Java.  

## Assignment
This repository is only a place to post code, and if you want, to comment on others code. THE ACTUAL ASSIGNMENT MUST BE
SUBMITTED IN ETUDES. [https://myetudes.org/portal](https://myetudes.org/portal). Once you are logged into Etudes, go to the 
"Assignments, Tests, and Surveys" link on the left hand sidebar. Then, look for "Team Project-Algorithm Implementation". 
When you open the assignment, professor Yuen describes the project, and you provide links and answers there. Again, this 
repository is just a place to post your code, it is NOT the same as turning in the assignment.
