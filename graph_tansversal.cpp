	Wesley Shaw
	Program demo
	flight distance calculator using DFS transversal of a graph.  
	The main purpose of the program is to demonstrates the application of graphs, and the way to manipulate data with them. 

	-My program  starts with a console prompt to log their choice of departure and arrival cities from a static list of 4 cities.

	-The program then saves their choice and saves that data into variables

	-The program then calculates the fastest route from departure city to arrival city. This is done by graph data structure.

	-The graph used is weighted meaning the lines between vertices(cities) have varying distances. The distances cannot be                   
 		changed, they are hardcoded and included in a header file

	- not all  flights are direct, meaning to get to point B you'll need a layover at C where perhaps C and D share a direct flight.  
  	 	this is done by looking at corresponding edges and if they match (0,1) and (1,0) 1 and 0 have direct flight
  
	-the graph once created is searched to find the shortest path between arrival city and departure city

	-this is done using DFS algorithm that back tracks through the edges between vertices to find the optimal path

	-the output consists of a prompt that informs the user if the flight is a direct flight or indirect, 
  		and the total miles the flight is between arrival and departure city.
