//Pseudocode for the Binary Search Algorithm.

//This Binary Search Algorithm can be used when the list is sorted in order of increasing size. 
//For example, if the elements are numbers, they are listed from smallest to largest and if 
//they are words, they are listed in alphabetical order.

//Best Case: O(1) Worst Case: O(log N)

procedure binary search (x: integer, a1, a2, . . . , an: increasing integers) 
i := 1{i is left endpoint of search interval} 
j := n {j is right endpoint of search interval} 
while i < j 
  m := ⌊(i + j)/2⌋ 
  if x > am then i :=m+1 
  else j := m 
if x = ai then location := i 
else location := 0 
return location{location is the subscript i of the term ai equal to x, or 0 if x is not found}
